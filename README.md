# Todolist-VueJS-Application
This application is a basic todolist developed with the UI framework Vue JS. Literally the component management is really awesome with Vue JS. Vue JS recommends and makes us used to integrade all backend task as an API and that is way too helpful for all developers out there. State management with the application is done in the next step of Vue JS that is Vuex.
